## Overview

Chris Ball has mentioned a project that might raise us some cash for the new CNC

## Design Specs

Large version of this

  * http://507movements.com/mm_123.html

  * Linear distance to travel being scaled to 2 feet (0.6m)
  * The following are guesses: Wood or plastic, with metal shafts, driven by a 12v motor of some sort,
  * Hi all, budget is £200 just to make the gears and rack from plywood. No other fixings required.
  * does not need to move fast (maybe 2 oscillations/mins) so gearboxes required
  * Timescale: Non-urgent I believe, by the end of the year would be nice

## Current Design

  * The motion of travel should be around 0.6m or 2ft
  * The scale of the gears is based on the svg from Phil C
  * The tooth profile's has been redone using GearTrax

## TODO

  * Not sure of the thickness of ply to use, currently assuming 8mm thick with 8mm threaded rod / nuts / washers etc
    Holes are sized at 8.1mm to give a bit of clearance when turning instead of sticking

  * There's no endstops on the centre back gear or the centre Rack
    I suspect these can be glued on / screwed on and may need tinkering a bit to get them in the right place.

  * There's no bearings on the gears currently. If they're added we'll need to think about how to add them in

  * There's no support / hold for the rack
    a simple bracket might get caught up with the tooth's on the rack, so maybe a piece of straight metal rod and some cheap linear bearings might do the trick

  * There will need to be an arrangement for a geared motor on the back, and power supply
    perhaps something like this https://www.ebay.com.au/itm/GW370-12V-6rpm-Reversible-High-Worm-Geared-Motor-Torque-Turbo-DC-Motor-35A-Y2E7-/253179099572
    not sure of the rpm's needed
