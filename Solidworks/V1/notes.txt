## Back Gear

inport as dxf, sketch, select mm as range

when imported
for gear teeth:
outer dia is 37.83mm
inner dia is 33.09mm
30 teeth

Using a Gear standard of Stub Involoute 20deg
pitch diameter 101.810mm - X
outer dia 107.240mm - X
inner dia 95.023mm - X

## Front Gear

inport as dxf, sketch, select mm as range

when imported
for gear teeth:
outer dia is 61.13mm
inner dia is 55.3mm
15 teeth over angle of 116.13deg
45 teeth total i think for a full circle

## Rack

the number of teeth is 15
14 in the middle, and half of 1 at each end

outer dia 17.2mm
inner dia 10.4mm
length on svg is 102.16mm
distance of travel is probably around 88.74mm

we need a distance of travel of around 2ft = 609.6mm
